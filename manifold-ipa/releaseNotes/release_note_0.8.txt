Manifold Release Note

Current release: 0.8
Release date: 06-28-2012


What's New in This Version

This is the first beta release of Manifold. It includes the parallel simulation kernel,
four computer architecture models, and six simulator programs. The focus of the release
is the sequential simulator programs in the directory QsimLib, which have been tested
with the PARSEC and SPLASH benchmarks for 100M cycles.

Brief description of the components is as follows:

1. The parallel simulation kernel.
The simulation kernel can be used in both sequential mode (one logical process) and
parallel mode (multiple logical processes). However, in this release, the focus is
on sequential mode.

2. Architecture Models:

2.1 Zesto
This is cycle-level x86 processor model built on top of SimpleScalar and modified for
Manifold. The model can take instruction input from three different sources: Qsim
server, Qsim library, and PIN traces.

2.2 MCP-cache
This is coherence cache model using the methodology called Manager-Client Pairing (MCP).
MCP-cache models a cache system that consists of two levels: the L1 cache where the
coherence is enforced, and the L2 cache that serves as the directory. Two configurations
are supported. In the 1st configuration, each processor has a private L1. The L2 is shared
but each processor node has an L2 slice. In the second configuration, each processor has
a private L1. The L2 is shared but resides in a separate node of its own. Only the MESI
protocol is supported.

2.3 Iris
This is a cycle level interconnection network model. Two network topologies are supported:
torus and ring. For each topology, the network consists of a set of network interfaces, 
each connected to a router. Virtual channel is supported.

2.4 CaffDRAM
This is a DRAM controller model. In this model, the memory is orgainzed as a hierarchy of
channels, ranks, and banks. For each request, the memory access latency is calculated based
on the state of the target bank.


3. Simulators.
The release includes six simulator programs to cover the 2 system configurations and 3 sources
of instruction input. Simulators under QsimClient users Qsim server for instructions, simulators
under QsimLib users Qsim library, and simulators under TraceProc use PIN traces. The open-source
package libconfig++ is used to parse system configurations.




Limitations

A few important limitations of this release are:

1. Flow control between components are not supported.

2. Iris does not support request-reply networks in this version. The next
version will.

3. Performance of the parallel simulators needs improvement.
