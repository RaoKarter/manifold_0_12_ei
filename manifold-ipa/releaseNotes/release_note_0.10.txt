Manifold Release Note

Current release: 0.10
Release date: 05-17-2013


New Components
==============

simple-proc
    A simple 1-IPC processor model. It can use 3 different front-ends: tracefiles,
    Qsim library, and Qsim server.

spx
    A superscalar processor model that is much lighter than Zesto. It currently uses
    Qsim library for instructions.

simple-cache
    A basic, non-coherent cache model.


Bug Fixes
=========

- A mis-defined virtual function in tracecore in zesto caused crashes when running
certain benchmarks.

- Deadlock in Iris. To avoid deadlock, Iris' route computation assigns different VCs to
flits going from a lower-numbered node to a higher-numbered node and flits going from
high to low. Therefore low-to-high flits should not depend on high-to-low flits, and
vice versa. However, the FCFS (first-come-first-serve) policy used by the router components
to enforce point-to-point order can create a dependence between low-to-high and high-to-low
flits, and eventually cause deadlock. In the fix, the FCFS is enforced on a per-VC-basis
as opposed to per-port-basis. However, if packets from the same source to the same destination
can be assigned to different VCs, then point-to-point order is no longer guaranteed.


Updates
=======

kernel
------

- Implemented the Forecast Null Message (FNM) algorithm for better performance.


Zesto
-----

- Tracecore now has 2 subclasses that respectively support multiple tracefiles for each core,
and loop around to the beginning of a tracefile.


MCP-cache
---------

- A structure, LP_LLS_unit, encapsulates an LLP cache, an LLS cache, and a mux, so that the user
no longer have to create the individual components and connect them.

- L1_cache, LLP_cache, LLS_cache, mux all have a tick() function and are registered to a clock
so that events from different input ports are handled in a deterministic manner. L2_cache is still
not registered with a clock because it only has one input port.

- Supports selective debug logging. A compiler flag, MCP_DBG_FILTER, allows a condition to be set
such that logs are only produced when the condition is met. For example, this can be used to 
generate logs only during a certain simulation period.


Iris
----

- Routers can now be assigned to different LPs.
- Support stats on end-to-end delays. This is controlled by the compiler flag IRIS_STATS_T2T_DELAY.
